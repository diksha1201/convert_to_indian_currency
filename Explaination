convert_to_indian_currency function:

It takes an integer number as input.
Converts the integer to a string num_str for easier manipulation.
Initializes variables like result to store the result string and count to keep track of the digits processed.
The function uses a for loop to iterate over each digit of the number in reverse order (starting from the least significant digit).

Inside the loop:

Checks if count is equal to 2, which means two digits have been processed. If true, it adds a comma to the result string.
Appends the current digit to the front of the result string.
Increments the count variable.
After the loop, it checks if there is a leading comma in the result string and removes it if present.

The function returns the final formatted result.

Example usage:

Defines an input_number variable with the value 504678.
Calls the convert_to_indian_currency function with input_number and stores the result in output_currency.
Prints the input and output for demonstration.
In the example, the input 504678 is converted to the Indian currency notation 5,04,67. The code achieves this by inserting commas after every two digits from the right.
